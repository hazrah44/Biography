<!--Requirements:
Using only HTML 5 and CSS (no JavaScript or other languages):
You will be building upon your Assignment 1 submission. Make a copy of your
three (3) page website and style it according to the requirements outlined below.
1. Every page must be styled using the same external style sheet to provide
a consistent look and feel across all pages.
2. The CSS declarations within your style sheet should provide at least three
(3) distinct differences in how the pages are presented based on the
screen size. Use media queries to accomplish this.
3. Use selectors to style all appropriate elements on all pages using CSS.
a. Each element selected should have at least one property:value pair
assigned to it. Providing more than one property:value pair for each
element is encouraged and will be acknowledged as extra effort.
b. Examples of elements that are not appropriate to apply styles to
include: doctype, html, head, title, and a few select others. Check
with your facilitator if you are unsure or if you would like to request a
rea sonable exception from this requirement.

considerable time thinking about and planning out the appearance of your

and sizes, special alignments and positioning, page layout,
navigation/menu appearance, etc.
